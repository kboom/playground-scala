/**
  * A candy vending machine FSM
  *
  * The Machine has two types of input
  *  - you can insert a coin
  *  - you can turn the knob
  *
  * The Machine can be in one of two states
  *  - locked
  *  - unlocked
  *
  * It also tracks how many candies are left and how many coins it contains
  *
  * The rules are as follows:
  *
  * - Inserting a coin into a locked machine will cause it to unlock if there's any candy left.
  * - Turning the knob on an unlocked machine will cause it to dispense candy and become locked.
  * - Turning the knob on a locked machine or inserting a coin into an unlocked machine does nothing.
  * - A machine thatâ€™s out of candy ignores all inputs.
  *
  * This is taken from [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/)
